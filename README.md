# Project Title

FABRICATION O F SIX LEGGED ROBOT FOR AGRICULTURAL PURPOSE WHICH CAN SEEDAND SPRAY THE WATER..

# Working Priniciple
The motion to robot is provided by a motor and a set of gears. additionally water tank is provided at the back of the robot and a pump and a sprinkler arrangement are provided such that the water is pumped to the sprinkler and thewater is sprayed for the agricultural field. The seeding setup consists of a hopperseed sprinkler operated by a motor. the seeds are fed manually into the hopper and when the bolt is released it starts falling into the seed sprinkler. * motor delivers power to the seed sprinkler such that the seed is sprinkled in the cultivation fields.Thus when the whole setup is switched on the robot automatically walks and theseeds are sprinkled into the field and the water is sprayed automatically


## Introduction
The hexapod is an insect inspired robot which has six legs that enables to move flexibly on various terrains. The main advantage of this type of robot is itsstability. The nature inspired the researchers and new innovative ideas come inmind but sometimes they are simple and effective sometimes cumbersome and critical line of the first walking machines was developed in about by Russian & athematician chebyshev   This  walking machine had four legs arranged into pairs. Legged machine have been used for at least a hundred years and are superior to wheels in some aspects
Legged locomotion should be mechanically superior to wheel or to
tracked locomotion over a variety of soil conditions and certainly superior for crossing obstacles
